[Here is a link to the final project](https://KeisGSmit.github.io/PrideHackathon)

This site is an information site about the history of the LGBTQ+ movement. 
It is designed to be responsive on a wide range of devices, whilst also being easy to navigate through. 
It was created for an LGBTQ+ themed proud-coders Hackathon with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) in June 2021.

## User Experience (UX)
### Initial Discussion
For the proud-coders Hackathon, we were asked to contribute to finding solutions that amplify LGBTQ+ voices, connect the community, that educate others, that support the needs of LGBT+ people. The overall objective was to build something that promotes and celebrates the LGBTQ+ community. We spoke to friends of ours who are in the LGBTQ+ community, and there was an overall feeling that many of them didn't know the history of Pride.

### User Stories
#### Client Goals
* To learn more about the history of Pride, and the momentous steps that were taken up to the present day.

#### First Time Visitor Goals
* It should be easy to understand how to use the site.
* The information should be clear to read.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
* The site should look good, so a user would feel happy to show their friends.

---
## Design
### Color Scheme
* We used a rainbow color scheme to fit with the theme of Pride, using black and white for other areas so as to not overwhelm the user. We also used black with a low opacity to help the text pop from the background more.

### Typography
* We used the Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif font-family, as we knew it wouldn't cause any issues across browsers, as they're standard fonts.
* This font-family is also easy to read, and allows the text to be easily legible for all users.

### Imagery
* We only used the up to date Pride flag in the date circles, to link with the theme of the Hackathon, as well as supporting all of those in the LGBTQ+ movement.
* We used an animated gif of a pride flag sending out love hearts to show the love that comes with being a part of Pride.
* We used basic backgrounds in bright colors for the carousel, to link with the Pride rainbow.

### Wireframes
[Here is the wireframe for desktop for this project](src/docs/wireframes.pdf).

### Features
* There is a copyright function at the bottom that automatically updates to the current year.
* There is a hide / show function to show or hide the information for each date on click.
* There is also an embedded Spotify player on the Community page, with podcasts on relating to the LGBTQ+ Community.

### Audio
* No audio is used on this site.

For a more detailed version of these steps, go to the [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop) page on this topic.

## Testing
### W3C Validator
The W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator and JSHint were used to validate the project to ensure there were no syntax errors within the site.

1. W3C Markup Validator
    * [HTML Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fkeisgsmit.github.io%2FPrideHackathon%2F)

2. W3C CSS Validator
    * [CSS Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fkeisgsmit.github.io%2FPrideHackathon%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
    * There is one error showing up, which is "text is not a background-clip value : text". This is a common validation error, and when we did research into this, it was common knowledge that it should be ignored, because text is a valid background-clip value.

3. JSHint
    * [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

### Testing User Stories
#### Client Goals
##### To learn more about the history of Pride, and the momentous steps that were taken up to the present day.
* Each main moment of the Pride movement in the USA has been included, with information about each event.

#### First Time Visitor Goals
##### It should be easy to understand how to use the site.
* Everything is easy to view on the main page.
* We have included a small instruction at the top, of how to view the information.

##### The information should be clear to read.
* All information is white text on a black transprent background, making the text clear to read.
* We have also used a standard font-family, so users won't be distracted by the font.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
##### The site should look good, so a user would feel happy to show their friends.
* The site has an attractive background rainbow, and a rainbow as the header.
* The layout is appealing, whilst also being simple so as to not over-clutter the screen.

#### Desktop / Laptop
1. Google Chrome
    * All tested and working correctly.

2. Microsoft Edge
    * All tested and working correctly.

3. Mozilla Firefox
    * All tested and working correctly.

### Further Testing
The website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Samsung Internet browsers. We did not test on Internet Explorer, as it has now been depreciated in favour of Microsoft Edge.
The website was viewed on a variety of devices, including:
* Acer Aspire V Nitro Laptop, running Windows 10
* Lenovo B51 IntelCore i7 Laptop, running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017), running macOS Catalina
* MacBookAir7,2 (13-inch, 2017)
* iPad 6,11 5th generation, running iOS 10.3
* iPhone X
* iPhone 12
* OPPO Find X2
* OPPO Find X2 Lite
* Samsung Galaxy S9
* Samsung A20
* xBox One

A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all information was visible or hidden correctly, and all functions worked as they should.
Friends, family members, and other developers were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues that they came across.

### Solved Bugs
1. The proper layout design wasn't showing for one of our developers.
    * We checked that he had the latest pull of the repo.
    * We used DevTools to check his code was being included properly.
    * We could see that width and height: fit-content weren't being accepted on his browser.
    * As he was using Firefox, we checked on [CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/?search=fit-content) to find out the correct prefixes to make this work on Firefox.
    * We then added in a -moz- prefix, which fixed this bug.

### Known Bugs
* No bugs have been knowingly left in this site.
* If you find any bugs, please contact one of the team on our GitHub links below.

### Lighthouse
We tested our website using Google DevTools [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) feature, and got these results:

#### Desktop
![Lighthouse desktop first try](src/docs/lighthousedesktop.png)

#### Mobile
![Lighthouse mobile first try](src/docs/lighthousemobile.png)

#### Performance:
* The only place we lost performance was very minor amounts of images not being properly sized, and video formats being required for animated content. These were both due to the gif we've used in our footer.
* Our images also do not have explicit width and height, as we opted for our images being more responsive.
* All other issues were due to us using Bootstrap, which we decided was a worthwhile trade-off due to the speed at which we were able to complete this project.
* These issues were magnified on mobile, as the images were not properly sized at all for mobile, as they were shrunk down from the desktop size.

#### Accessibility:
* We were incredibly careful to ensure that we had a fully accessible site.
* All images have alt attributes.
* All tap targets are above the required minimum of 48px.

#### Best Practices:
* This also suffered from our images - both incorrect aspect ratio, and low resolution. This is caused by our carousel images, which we were unable to edit.

#### SEO:
* We ensured we had full meta tags in our head element.
* We also have a valid rel="canonical" tag in our head to tell search engines the source of truth for our site.
* All external links being set with target="_blank" and rel="noopener" to avoid any security risks.
