                                World War I veteran Henry Gerber founded the Society for Human Rights in Chicago.
                                The group was the first gay rights group in America, and its newsletter, “Friendship
                                and Freedom,” was the United States’ first recorded gay rights publication.

                                publication, ONE: The Homosexual Magazine, the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court — and
                                the court ruled in favor of gay rights for the first time, making it a major landmark case
                                in LGBTQ history.

                                one of the country’s first gay rights organizations, staged a “Sip-In,” during which
                                activists entered a New York City bar, announced they were gay, ordered drinks, and
                                waited to be served.

                                In the early morning hours on June 28, 1969, police performed a raid of the Stonewall Inn,
                                a New York City gay bar — and the customers and their supporters took a stand. The event
                                turned into a violent protest and led to a days-long series of riots. Those “Stonewall riots” are
                                largely considered the start of the LGBTQ civil rights movement in the United States.

                                President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law.
                                The act was named for two men who were murdered in hate crimes — Matthew Shepard because he was gay, 
                                and James Byrd, Jr. because he was black. The new law expanded previous hate crime legislation to officially
                                categorize crimes motivated by actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability as hate crimes.

                                roles in both the Stonewall riots and the NYC queer scene in general. The two started

                                to helping LGBTQ people experiencing homelessness. The monument will commemorate the 50th
