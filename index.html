                            surgeries in 23 states, of which 2,500 used his ice-pick procedure, despite the fact
                            that he had no formal surgical training. Up to 40% of Freeman's patients were gay
                            individuals subjected to a lobotomy in order to change their homosexual orientation,
                            leaving most of these individuals severely disabled for the rest of their lives.

                        <p>Vermont became the first state in the country to give same-sex couples the right to enter
                            into civil unions — legal partnerships which would grant those couples the same rights and
                            benefits as those
                            in legal marriages. The 79-to-68 vote to create civil unions set off sighs of relief, tears
                            and hugs among the three same-sex couples whose 1997 lawsuit seeking the right to marry led

                            civil union in court using the same procedures and laws as for divorce. Those civil unions
                            continue to be recognized in Vermont, and couples joined in civil union have access to
                            Vermont's family court in the event that they break up.</p>

                            because he
                            was gay, and James Byrd, Jr. because he was black. The new law expanded previous hate crime

                        <p>Just ahead of Pride 2019, New York City announced it will erect a monument in Greenwich
                            village dedicated to Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, activists who played critical
                            roles in both the Stonewall riots and the NYC queer scene in general. The two started
                            Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (S.T.A.R.) in 1970, an organization dedicated
                            to helping LGBTQ people experiencing homelessness. The monument will commemorate the 50th
                            anniversary of the Stonewall riots, according to the New York Times.</p>
