After the U.S. Post Office refused to deliver America’s first widely distributed pro-gay

in LGBTQ history.

In the early morning hours on June 28, 1969, police performed a raid of the Stonewall Inn,

President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law.

The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which became a law in 1996, declared that
marriages between gay or lesbian couples were not recognized by the federal government,

which meant same-sex couples married in their own states could receive those federal benefits.

the anti-discrimination policy.

Fund, told NBC News.

to helping LGBTQ people experiencing homelessness. The monument will commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the Stonewall riots, according to the New York Times.
